# PathfindingAlgoirthmVizualizer
Welcome to Algorithm Visualizer, a Java-based GUI application that helps understand and visualize pathfinding, and eventually sorting algorithms. This project is built using Swing and designed to offer an interactive learning experience for students.






Features:

Visualize the step-by-step process of:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

(Planned: A* Algorithm, Dijkstras Algorithm)






Create customizable maps with:

Start node

End node

Walls 

Adjustable grid and responsive controls

User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing



Technologies

Java 8+

Swing for GUI

Object-oriented design



Planned Features

A* Pathfinding algorithm

Adjustable speed for visualization

Adjustable grid size

Maze generation tool

Sorting Algorithm Vizualization



Getting Started

Make sure you have:

Java JDK 8 or later

An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
