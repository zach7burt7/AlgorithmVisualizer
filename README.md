# PathfindingAlgoirthmVizualizer
Welcome to Algorithm Visualizer, a Java-based GUI application that helps understand and visualize pathfinding, and eventually sorting algorithms. This project is built using Swing and designed to offer an interactive learning experience for students.

## Features:
Visualize the step-by-step process of:  
BFS   
DFS  
A*  
(Planned: Dijkstras Algorithm)  

## Create customizable maps with:  
Start node  
End node  
Walls  
Adjustable grid and responsive controls  
User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing  

## Technologies  
Java 8+  
Swing for GUI  
Object-oriented design  

## Planned Features  
Sorting Algorithm Vizualization  

## Getting Started  
Make sure you have:  
Java JDK 8 or later  
An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)  
Git: `https://git-scm.com/downloads`
